##   Syntax highlighting for Stata in Sublime text

This is a hacked version of the textmate bundle from http://bylr.net/3/2010/10/stata-bundle-for-textmate/.

There are a few modifications
- compound quotes are supported
- digits are highlighted

There are a few problems
- double forward slash doesn't work as a comment marker at the beginning of a line

Hope it might be useful.
